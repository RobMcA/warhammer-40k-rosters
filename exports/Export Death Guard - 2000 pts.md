**++ Roster Rules ++**


. **Daemonic Ritual:** Instead of moving in their Movement phase, any DEATH GUARD CHARACTER can, at the end of their Movement phase, attempt to summon a NURGLE DAEMON unit with this ability by performing a Daemonic Ritual (the character cannot do so if they arrived as reinforcements this turn).

Roll up to 3 dice - this is your summoning roll. You can summon one new NURGLE DAEMON unit with the Daemonic Ritual ability to the battlefield that has a Power Rating equal to or less than the total result. This unit is treated as reinforcements for your army and can be placed anywhere on the battlefield that is entirely within 12" of the character and is more than 9" from any enemy model. If the total rolled is insufficient to summon any unit, the ritual fails and no new unit is summoned.

If your summoning roll included any doubles, your character then suffers a mortal wound. If it contained any triples, it instead suffers D3 mortal wounds.

. **Inexorable Advance:** If your Army is Battle-forged, all INFANTRY and HELBRUTE units in DEATH GUARD Detachments gain this ability. Such units do not suffer a penalty for moving and firing Heavy Weapons, or for Advancing and firing Assault weapons. In addition, a unit with this ability can fire twice with Rapid Fire weapons at a range of 18", instead of only being able to fire twice with them up to half the weapon's maximum range.

. **Malicious Volleys:** All DEATH GUARD units in Codex: Death Guard (excluding CHAOS CULTISTS units and POXWALKERS units) gain this ability:

Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, Rapid Fire bolt weapons used by models in a unit with this ability make double the number of attacks if any of the following apply:
• The firing model’s target is within half the weapon’s maximum range.
• The firing model belongs to an INFANTRY unit and every model from that unit remained stationary in your
previous Movement phase.
• The firing model is a TERMINATOR , BIKER or HELBRUTE.

For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any weapon with the Rapid Fire type whose profile includes the word ‘bolt’ (e.g. boltgun, combi-bolter, etc.)

. **Plague Host:** If your army is Battle-forged, all Troops units in DEATH GUARD Detachments gain this ability. Such a unit that is within range of an objective marker (as specified in the mission) controls that objective marker even if there are more enemy models within range of it. If an enemy unit within range of the same objective marker has a similar ability, then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range as normal.

. **Plague Weapon:** You can re-roll wound rolls of 1 for a weapon with this ability.

&nbsp;

**++ Selection Rules ++**


. **Hateful Assault:** If this unit makes a charge move, is charged or performs a Heroic Intervention, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in this unit until the end of the turn.
