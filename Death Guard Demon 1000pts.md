## Roster Rules

- **Inexorable Advance:** If your Army is Battle-forged, all INFANTRY and HELBRUTE units in DEATH GUARD Detachments gain this ability. Such units do not suffer a penalty for moving and firing Heavy Weapons, or for Advancing and firing Assault weapons. In addition, a unit with this ability can fire twice with Rapid Fire weapons at a range of 18", instead of only being able to fire twice with them up to half the weapon's maximum range.
- **Malicious Volleys:** All DEATH GUARD units in Codex: Death Guard (excluding CHAOS CULTISTS units and POXWALKERS units) gain this ability:

>Instead of following the normal rules for Rapid Fire weapons, Rapid Fire bolt weapons used by models in a unit with this ability make double the number of attacks if any of the following apply:

- The firing model’s target is within half the weapon’s maximum range.
- The firing model belongs to an INFANTRY unit and every model from that unit remained stationary in your
previous Movement phase.
- The firing model is a TERMINATOR , BIKER or HELBRUTE.

>For the purposes of this ability, a Rapid Fire bolt weapon is any weapon with the Rapid Fire type whose profile includes the word ‘bolt’ (e.g. boltgun, combi-bolter, etc.)

- **Plague Host:** If your army is Battle-forged, all Troops units in DEATH GUARD Detachments gain this ability. Such a unit that is within range of an objective marker (as specified in the mission) controls that objective marker even if there are more enemy models within range of it. If an enemy unit within range of the same objective marker has a similar ability, then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range as normal.
- **Plague Weapon:** You can re-roll wound rolls of 1 for a weapon with this ability.

### Selection Rules

- **Hateful Assault:** If this unit makes a charge move, is charged or performs a Heroic Intervention, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of models in this unit until the end of the turn.

| **Smite**                  | 5           | 18"   | Smite has a warp charge value of 5. If manifested, the closest visible enemy unit within 18" of the psyker suffers D3 mortal wounds (pg 181). If the result of the Psychic test was more than 11 the target suffers D6 mortal wounds instead.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Miasma of Pestilence**   | 6           | 18"   | If manifested, select a visible friendly DEATH GUARD unit within 18" of the psyker. Until the start of your next Psychic phase, your opponent must subtract 1 from all hit rolls that target that unit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Blades of Putrefaction** | 5           | 18"   | If manifested, select a visible friendly DEATH GUARD unit within 18" of the psyker. Until the start of your next Psychic phase, add 1 to all wound rolls made by that unit in the Fight phase. Furthermore, any wound rolls of 7+ made for that unit in the Fight phase with a melee plague weapon (i.e. a plaguesword or any weapon with the Plague Weapon ability) inflict a mortal wound on the target in addition to any other damage. |

- *Hateful Assault, Death to the False Emperor, Disgustingly Resilient*
- **Pestilential Fallout:** Each time this model successfully manifests a psychic power with a Psychic test of 7 or more, the nearest enemy unit within 7" suffers a mortal wound after the effects of the psychic power have been resolved.
